<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Today Lenovo Open Cloud Automation uses a heavy bootstrap process. All the bootstrap services (AWX, Gitlab, Netbox, etc.) are deployed in the form of Virtual Machines. Therefore it takes a long time and space. 
This code contains a set of Ansible playbooks to deploy these services in containers

### Built With

* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
